# JappeOS Core
The core of JappeOS, manages all the "sub processes" of JappeOS (desktop, login screen, etc.).
This is meant to be run on Linux, not optimized for any other platform.

If you need a messaging system to send messages between processes; see: [JappeOS-Messaging](https://github.com/Jappe-OS/JappeOS-Messaging).
